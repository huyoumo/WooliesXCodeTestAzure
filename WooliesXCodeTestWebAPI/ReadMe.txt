- WooliesXCodeTest.BusinessLogic contains domain model, and handlers, those can be reused at domain level. UserHandler is defined as example.
- WooliesXCodeTestWebAPI contains API specific logic: Model, Controller
- WooliesXCodeTest.Test contains tests: unit tests for UserController and UserHandler are defined as example.

Could to if have more time: 
- IOC
- define repository layer
